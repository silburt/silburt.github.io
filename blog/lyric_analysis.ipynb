    "Music has a profound influence on people. Whether we are simply listening to music as background noise or blocking out the world to listen to a favourite song, it affects our mood and reflects our values. [Research](http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-do-you-think-you-are-what-your-taste-music-says-about-you-according-science-317388) suggests that musical taste is more than a simple preference and is connected to our [Big-Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) personality traits. In addition, [a study by Sonos](https://www.fastcompany.com/3056554/how-music-changes-our-behavior-at-home) showed that music can physically change our behaviour, with couples reporting 66% more intimacy, 33% more likely to cook together and 85% more likely to invite people over when music is playing.\n",

    "Lyrics play an essential role in music, encoding the feelings, moods and philosophies of the artist. Although every song is different, are there overarching themes associated with various genres? For example, when you are feeling very happy is there a particular genre of music you're most likely to listen to? How does that change if you are sad? What about mad?\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "The code used for this project comes from my [Machine Learning Repo](https://github.com/silburt/Machine_Learning/). \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need some songs. I picked a few playlists from Spotify: \n",
    "- <i>Country Top Songs of 2000-2017</i> by sjwheat (1567 songs)\n",
    "- <i>Best EDM Playlist on the Planet!</i> by Matt Hoppe (1592 songs)\n",
    "- <i>Greatest Rock Songs Ever</i> by Max John Maybury (1049 songs)\n",
    "- <i>Super Top Hits 2000-2016</i> by Michele Insalata (1603 songs)\n",
    "- <i>BEST of RAP</i> by Andy Mathers (2128 songs)\n",
    "\n",
    "and converted these playlists to csvs [here](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify), with each csv row containing the artist, song, album, etc. for each entry. Then, I scraped each lyric from the genius.com API using standard Python packages like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`. A good fraction of songs (20-40% per genre) weren't recognized in the genius.com API due to e.g. slightly different names between spotify and genius, mix version, etc. I also removed any songs that had fewer than 15 words (i.e. instrumentals). In total, I obtained 1000 songs from each genre for the following analysis."

    "You can clearly notice [Zipfs Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), an empirical law which states that the $\\rm{frequency}$ of a word is inversely proportional to its $\\rm{rank}$. Mathematically:\n",

    "where $p$ is an exponent (in the ideal case $p=1$, in practice usually not true).\n",
    "An equivalent statement is that the distribution of words forms a powerlaw, and should look like a straight line in log-log space. \n",

    "So for example, if we take the 1st, 20th and 40th most common words from the EDM genre:\n",

    "- __Hip-Hop__: (Probably unsurprisingly), it's focused on women, money, and sex.

    "- __Rock__: Still seems to have retained some overarching themes from the 60s and 70s maybe, with popular words like woman, soul and people. Not sure what to make of the disproportionately rare words... maybe rock musicians hate \"hard work\" :P?\n",
    "- __Country__: Country seems to be focused on the simpler things in life (song, kiss, road), and also <i>really</i> likes to miniaturize things - \"little baby\", \"little thing\", \"little kisses\", etc., with \"little\" being the top unique word.\n",
    "- __Pop__: Pop has no disproportionately popular/rare words, which is expected given that pop music draws from all the other genres. Country, Rock, Hip-Hop and EDM all penetrate the Top40s continuously. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDM and Hip-Hop seem to be the two most distinct genres, having the most number of disproportionately popular/rare words (there are more disproportionately rare words for both genres not shown here)."
