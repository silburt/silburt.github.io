    "The code used for this project comes from https://github.com/silburt/Machine_Learning/. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need some songs. I picked a few <em>\"Best of (insert genre here)\"</em> playlists from Spotify and extracted a csv from [here](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) containing the artist and song for each entry. Then, I scraped each lyric from the genius.com API using standard Python packages like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`. In total, I obtained roughly 1000 different songs released between 2000-2017 for each of: EDM, Hip-Hop, Country, Rock and Pop. All the relevant code for this is contained [here](https://github.com/silburt/Machine_Learning/).\n"

    "The first interesting thing about these graphs is the clear presence of [Zipfs Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), which is an interesting empirical law that states that the $\\rm{frequency}$ of a word is inversely proportional to its $\\rm{rank}$. Put another way, it should be universally true that:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "An equivalent statement is that the distribution of words forms a powerlaw, and should look like a straight line in a log-log plot (indeed these plots do, not shown here). \n",

The table below shows the average words per song, and we see that Pop has more words per song than even Hip-Hop, which is a bit surprising to me considering that lyrics play an especially central role in Hip-hop. It does however make sense (to me at least) that EDM would have the fewest words per song. Often times I get the feeling that EDM lyrics are a bumper sticker afterthought...\n",
