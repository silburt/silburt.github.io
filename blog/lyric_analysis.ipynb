    "## Setup\n",
    "The code used for this project comes from https://github.com/silburt/Machine_Learning/. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need some songs. I picked a few playlists from Spotify: \n",
    "- Country Top Songs of 2000-2017 (1567 songs)\n",
    "- Best EDM Playlist on the Planet! (1592 songs)\n",
    "- Greatest Rock Songs Ever (1049 songs)\n",
    "- Super Top Hits 2000-2016 (1603 songs)\n",
    "- BEST of RAP (2128 songs)\n",
    "\n",
    "and converted the playlists to csvs [here](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) where each row contains the artist, song, album, etc. for each entry. Then, I scraped each lyric from the genius.com API using standard Python packages like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`. A good fraction of songs (20-40% per genre) weren't recognized in the genius.com API due to e.g. slightly different names between spotify and genius, mix version, etc. I also removed any songs that had fewer than 15 words (i.e. instrumentals). In total at least 1000 songs were obtained for each genre, and will use exactly 1000 songs from each genre for the following analysis.\n"

    "You can clearly notice [Zipfs Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), an empirical law which states that the $\\rm{frequency}$ of a word is inversely proportional to its $\\rm{rank}$. In math:\n",

    "- __Hip-Hop__: (Probably unsurprisingly), it's focused on women, money, and sex. J-Cole speaks the truth when he says (in G.O.M.D.), \"_It's called love, Ni\\*\\*as don't sing about it no more_\". \"Love\" was the most striking example of a word that had a disproportionately low rank in a specific genre. This trend seems to persist, having other romantic words like \"heart\", \"our\", \"light\", \"eyes\" being disproportionately rare in Hip-Hop.\n",
    "- __Rock__: Still seems to have retained some overarching themes from the 60s and 70s maybe, with popular words like woman, soul and people. Not sure what to make of the disproportionately rare words... maybe rock musicians hate \"hard work\" :P?\n",
    "- __Country__: Unsurprisingly, Country seems focused on the simpler things in life (song, kiss, road), and also _really_ likes to miniaturize things - \"little baby\", \"little thing\", \"little kisses\", etc., with \"little\" being the top unique word.\n",
    "- __Pop__: Pop has no disproportionately popular/rare words, which is expected given that pop music draws from all the other genres. Country, Rock, Hip-Hop and EDM all penetrate the Top40s continuously. In contrast, EDM and Hip-Hop seem to be the two most distinct genres, having the most number of disproportionately popular/rare words (there are more disproportionately rare words for both genres not shown here)."
