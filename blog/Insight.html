                From June - August 2018 I attended <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> in New York City as a Data Science Fellow. Insight is a 7 week program designed to transition individuals from academia into careers as data scientists. During the first 3 weeks of the program I built <a href="http://git-screened.icu/">git-screened</a>, a web-app that analyzes whether a given GitHub repository is "prodcution grade" or not (production grade = characteristic of the 6000 most highly starred Python repositories on GitHub). I have since gotten a job as a Software Engineer at Bloomberg, and am very(!) happy about it. This blog post is intended to share my honest opinions about the pros and cons of program (Insight has no connection to this blog post), as well as how one can best prepare for Insight.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Overall Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                    The TL;DR summary of my experience at Insight is that it was definitely worth it. I ended up with my dream job at Bloomberg and is unlikely that I would have gotten the job without Insight. Not because I'm not qualified in principle, but because of Insight's connections to high profile companies and their ability to put your resume at the top of the pile. Insight also genuinely cares about you, and I really buy into the "family" mentality. As an example, one program director in particular really fought for me to move things along quickly at Bloomberg (I had an offer at another company with a firm deadline), and without them I definitely would not have ended up at Bloomberg, my first choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But, Insight was not without a lot of stress, including a few moments crying at 2am (I don't consider myself a crier). If you already have connections that can put your resume at the top of the pile, or don't need/want (new) employment on a fast timescale, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Insight as a first option.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Stress/Cost of Insight</h2>
                    <p>
                    I'm a "bad news first" kinda guy, so I'll start with the stresses/costs of Insight. The first 3 weeks of Insight are spent building a project, with weekly deadlines. After that you build a 5 minute demo, and present it to companies you are matched with, which (hopefully) leads to an interview. The project phase was a huge stressor for me, especially since I was late figuring out a project. Most fellows land on a project idea by the end of week 1, but I didn't until Wednesday of week 2. I thus felt 3-4 days behind everyone else (which is huge in Insight time), and early week 3 was having some serious doubts that I was cut out for the program and would actually make it. Week 3 was the toughest for me, and when I wasn't eating, sleeping or using the bathroom I was working on my Insight project. Intensity-wise, I felt more stressed during this single week than I can remember in recent history (more than writing my thesis, etc.). I knew going into Insight that "it would be hard", but nothing could have prepared me for the real intensity of it. One analogy might be becoming a parent (I'm not a parent myself but have heard this from Fellows) - you can think, "okay, I'm not going to get a lot of sleep, I may not see friends as much, I know it will be hard", but it's a different story when you're actually in the trenches going through the experience and trying to maintain balance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Although the project phase was the most stressful for me, once you land that first interview at Company X the project honestly becomes irrelevant. I can't speak for all companies, but none I interviewed at asked about my project (after the initial demo phase). In addition, since you're building a project in 3 weeks (and all your previous experiences have been in academia) most projects never reach their full potential and can have some real weaknesses. Some Fellows had to present less-than-ideal versions of their project (and thus themselves) to companies, which can be tough. That being said, it does generally look good on your resume to have completed a project in the fast-paced environment of Insight. Furthermore, as time moves forward and Data Science becomes more mature as a field, it seems to be harder and harder at coming up with a project that a) can be done in 3 weeks, b) provides genuine business value, and c) no Fellow/entity/company has done before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Before coming to Insight I was a postdoc in Astrophysics at Penn State University, and had to formally leave my postdoc, move to NYC, attend Insight, and land a job before my savings dried up. Insight doesn't cost any money to attend, but the cost of living in NYC with no income is expensive. Door to door (leaving Penn State -> first day of work at Bloomberg) I roughly spent $12,000, which is not crazyyy, but is also definitely not nothing (this also excludes the cost of finding a permanent place to live, which is at least another $5,000). Part of that expense also comes from having to fly back to Canada, await my visa documents from Bloomberg (I'm Canadian, eh), and fly back. I consider myself to be a pretty frugal person (e.g. I packed lunches most days), and was among the first wave of people getting jobs in my cohort. In addition, an added mental cost is I've been living out of two suitcases in temporary housing for the last 4 months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Funny enough, another member of the astrophysics department at Penn State left academia 2 months after I did and got a job in NYC at a company that Insight partners with. However, they did not go through Insight, and passively applied to jobs (while keeping their old one) until they landed one. That liekly resulted in a lot less stress, not to mention constant employment/pay. I would probably recommend this option first to anyone trying to get a job in Data Science <i>if</i> you currently have a job and don't mind being patient. The worst that happens is you don't get a new job and apply for Insight like you would have done anyway. In addition, <i>most</i> (~70%? of) people going through Insight land a job within a month or two after the program formally ends, but there's a long tail to that distribution where a few candidates can take 6-12 months to land a job. There were two candidates I met from previous sessions who had finally gotten jobs after 6 and 8 months of searching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Lastly, some members of my cohort expressed displeasure about the distribution of companies available. For some Fellows, only one or two companies out of 30 were remotely appealing, and if they didn't get those jobs they either had to interview at non-ideal choices or start looking elsewhere. The roles available to us ranged from consultant (stats heavy, client facing) to machine learning engineer (machine learning, CS, non-client facing). Although you <i>can</i> land a job at (insert preferred tech giant) coming through Insight, it's worth doing your homework before you apply to see which companies are available at which locations. The more traditional tech jobs (Google, Facebook, etc.) are mostly only available in Silicon Valley, with more finance/consulting jobs in NYC. Seattle/Toronto/Boston have their own flavours too.

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Benefits of Insight</h2>
                    <p>
                    There are a few big reasons why Insight was worthwhile. First and foremost, you do end up with a great job at a great company that will almost certainly pay 6-figures. Their connections are probably better than yours, and you get way more exposure/visibility to Data Science roles than you otherwise would get. As an example, one member of my cohort reported searching (unsuccessfully) for 6 months to get a job before coming to Insight, while after the program they were in the first wave of Fellows to get a job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Second, Insight felt like the real deal in terms of throwing you into the deep end and seeing how you swim. Although you will get constant feedback from peers/program directors on the big picture of your project, no one is going to do your project for you. It's up to you, and you alone, to get shit done, and there's no parent/supervisor/safety net to catch you if you fall. Although this can be a primary source of stress at Insight, I ultimately consider it a "feature not a bug". You learn a lot about yourself, grow faster than you otherwise would have, as well as find the limits of what you're capable of. More than a few times I heard (and share) the sentiment, "if I had this kind of productivity while doing my PhD I would have completed it in half the time!". This being said, week 3 was really tough for me and I don't want to go through it again anytime soon (I break into a cold sweat just thinking about it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Third, once accepted to Insight you really do become part of a family. Coming from academia, I didn't have a huge network of connections in data science to help with my transition. However, once accepted to Insight you instantly gain access to hundreds of Fellows who have gone through Insight and are now working in industry. I have leveraged this network for many purposes from project ideation to work visa advice. Every single Insight alum I've interacted with has been incredibly kind and helpful, and has especially motivated me to "pay it forward" and be as kind and helpful to future Fellows (and non-Fellows!) as I can. More importantly, you also become close with your cohort, bonding over both successes and stresses, inside and outside the office (or in our case, partying inside the office after hours (I know we're lame)). Many members of my cohort I consider to be close friends and will remain so into the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Fourth, it does really seem like the bond with Insight carries into the future. For example, waiting for my visa in Canada was stressful since there was some non-negligible chance that it wouldn't work out (long story). However, the Toronto location of Insight said they were absolutely willing to help me find another job in Canada should my visa not work out, a kind gesture that does not go unappreciated. In addition, while at Insight I saw a few examples of former Insight Fellows being helped by Insight to change jobs (from an existing one that they initially got through Insight!). There's no clear incentive for Insight to do this from a monetary perspective, as (to my understanding) they only get a cut from the initial placement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally, Insight does a great job of rounding out your skills and character in a short amount of time. Surrounded by a cohort of PhDs and program directors in a fast paced environment, you pick up data science skills a lot faster than you otherwise would have. You also get a lot of feedback/advice on "soft skills" that are important to thrive - effective communication, elevator pitches on your background/project, your resume, salary negotiation, etc. In addition, the "fail fast" mantra really feels true and makes you a better version of yourself than if you didn't go through the program. Throughout the program you constantly experience forms of rejection - your project idea needs work, after whiteboarding you realize you know wayyy less SQL than you thought, you didn't get a callback from Company X, etc. Similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vZXgApsPCQ">this guy</a> you become more comfortable with rejection, allowing you to grow more quickly.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to Best Prepare for Insight</h2>
                    <p>
                    For those who have been accepted to the program (congrats!!) but haven't started yet, there's a few things I'd recommend doing to maximize your chances of success. If you are thinking of applying to Insight but haven't been accepted yet, I'd still recommend doing all but the first:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    First, start thinking of project ideas now <i>and bounce them off people who have some combination of tech/business experience</i>. Before I came to Insight I had come up with 6 different project ideas, however I was still very much in an academic mentality. All of the ideas were (rightfully) rejected by the program directors in the first week, and I found myself having to start again from scratch. Being able to answer the question "How would my project generate business value for Company X today?", and "how could I generalize my project to generate business value for other companies/sectors?" are especially important to answer since you'll ultimately be demoing your project to mulitple companies and this question WILL come up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Second, learn Python. I saw a lot of Fellows struggle with their projects because they were simultaneously trying to learn Python and complete their project, making everything take twice as long. Reading a book about Python doesn't cut it. Do a little mini project in Python before the program starts. Ask your friend who is an experienced Python programmer to review your code and find a better way to code that triple-nested for loop. Do coding challenges on <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">leetcode</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Third, brush up on your machine learning. Broadly speaking, you should know about the popular supervised/unsupervised algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, recommender system, LDA, K-means), as well as best practices/concepts (cross validation, train/test split, bias-variance tradeoff, unbalanced classes, regularization, choosing the best loss function). More than memorizing an algorithm, it's important to know the pros/cons of each algorithm (e.g. when would I use logistic regression over random forest?). After the project phase you basically get 2 weeks of interview prep before interviews start, and the more of these concepts you're unfamiliar with the more you'll end up just cramming/memorizing vs. genuinely understanding. For the more tech-heavy roles the interviewers will know if you just memorized an algorithm yesterday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Fourth, improve your communication skills. Getting a job at Company X largely depends on your ability to explain your project and background to non-PhD business executives. If you are a really smart person but don't know how to communicate ideas to non-experts you are unlikely to get the job. Try explaining your PhD research to your grandmother. See if you can explain a machine learning paper you just read to your non-academic friend.
