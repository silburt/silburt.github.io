                <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> is a 7 week program designed to transition individuals from academia into careers as Data Scientists. From June - August 2018 I attended Insight in New York City as a Data Science Fellow, and for my project I built <a href="http://git-screened.icu/">git-screened</a>, a web-app that automates GitHub repository assessment (see <a href="https://github.com/silburt/git-screened">here</a> for more details about my project). Through Insight I got a job as a Software Engineer at Bloomberg, and am very(!) happy about it. This blog post is intended to share my experience at Insight, along with the pros and cons of program and how incoming Fellows can best prepare.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Overall Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                    The TL;DR summary of my experience at Insight is that it was definitely worth it. I ended up with my dream job at Bloomberg and is unlikely that I would have gotten the job without Insight. Not because I was previously unqualified for the role, but because Insight has connections to high profile companies and thus the ability to put your resume at the top of the pile. Insight also genuinely cares about you, and I feel like they go above and beyond their contractual obligations. For example, one program director fought on my behalf to move things along quickly at Bloomberg. Since I already had a job offer at another company (with a firm deadline approaching), Insight was guaranteed to get their commission. However, since Bloomberg was my top choice, Insight went out of their way and expended additional energy to help facilitate a fast interview timeline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This being said, Insight was not without a ton of stress, including a moment or two of crying at 2am (I'm not usually a crier). If you already have connections that can put your resume at the top of the pile, or don't need/want (new) employment on a fast timescale, my recommendation is that Insight should not be your first option.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Cons of Insight</h2>
                    <p>
                    I'll start with the cons of Insight, but first, a bit of background on the structure of the program. The first 3 weeks of Insight are spent building a project, and from your project you construct a 5 minute demo which is presented to companies and (hopefully) leads to an interview. If you don't finish your project, you can't make a demo, can't demo at companies, won't get an interview, and won't get a job. Each phase in the program depends on successful completion of the previous phase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For me, the project phase was the most stressful, especially since I was late figuring out a project. Most fellows land on a project idea by the end of week 1, but I didn't until Wednesday of week 2. I thus felt 3-4 days behind everyone else (which is significant in Insight time), and early week 3 was having some serious doubts that I would actually complete the program. During week 3, when I wasn't eating, sleeping or using the bathroom I was working on my Insight project, and intensity-wise I felt more stressed during this single week than I can remember (more than my thesis, etc.). I knew going into Insight that "it would be hard", but nothing could have prepared me for the real intensity of it. One analogy might be becoming a parent (I'm not a parent myself but have heard this from Fellows) - you can think, "okay, I'm not going to get a lot of sleep, I may not see friends as much, I know it will be hard", but it's a different story when you're actually in the trenches going through the experience and trying to maintain balance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Although the project phase was the most stressful for me, once you land that first interview at Company X the project you slaved over basically becomes irrelevant, and (I think) you're treated like any other candidate applying at Company X. In addition, since you're building a project in 3 weeks (and all your previous experiences have been in academia) most projects never reach their full potential and often have some real weaknesses. Some Fellows had to present less-than-ideal versions of their project (and thus themselves) to companies, which can be tough to constantly do over and over (while potentially watching other Fellows kill it). In addition, as time moves forward and Data Science becomes more mature as a field, it seems to be harder and harder to develop a project at Insight that a) can be done in 3 weeks, b) provides genuine business value, and c) no Fellow/entity/company has done before. This all being said, I think it does generally look good on your resume to have completed a project in the fast-paced environment of Insight (which provides some long-term value beyond the demo phase of Insight).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Before coming to Insight I was a postdoc in Astrophysics at Penn State University, and had to formally leave my postdoc, move to NYC, attend Insight, and land a job before my savings dried up. Insight doesn't cost any money to attend, but the cost of living in NYC with no income is expensive. Door to door (leaving Penn State -> first day of work at Bloomberg) I roughly spent $12,000 USD, which is not crazyyy, but is also definitely not nothing (this also excludes the cost of finding a permanent place to live, which is at least another $5,000). There was also an added mental cost of living out of two suitcases in temporary housing for ~4 months. I should note that part of the $12,000 came from having to fly back to Canada, await my visa documents from Bloomberg (I'm Canadian, eh), and fly back; I also attending a wedding over the summer. I consider myself to be a pretty frugal person (e.g. I packed lunches most days), and was among the first wave of people getting jobs in my cohort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Funny enough, another member of the astrophysics department at Penn State left academia 2 months after I did and got a job in NYC at a company that Insight partners with. However, they did not go through Insight, and passively applied to jobs (while keeping their old one) until they landed one. That likely resulted in a lot less stress, not to mention, constant employment/pay. I would probably recommend this option first to anyone trying to get a job in Data Science <i>if</i> you currently have a job and/or don't mind being patient. The worst that happens is you don't get a new job and apply for Insight like you would have done anyway. In addition, most (~70%? of) people going through Insight land a job within a month or two after the program formally ends, but there's a long tail to that distribution where a few candidates can take 6-12 months to land a job. There were two candidates I met from previous sessions who had finally gotten jobs after 6 and 8 months of searching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Lastly, although I was personally happy with the distribution of companies available, some members of my cohort expressed displeasure. For some Fellows, only one or two companies out of 30 were remotely appealing, and if they didn't get those jobs they either had to interview at non-ideal choices or start looking elsewhere. The roles available to us ranged from consultant (stats heavy, client facing) to machine learning engineer (machine learning/CS heavy, non-client facing), and everything in between. So it's worth keeping in mind that e.g. if you're dead set on a machine learning engineer role, there may only be 5 or 6 companies for you, and that's before you start filtering for the other things you also care about. In addition, although you <i>can</i> land a job at (insert preferred tech giant) coming through Insight, it's worth doing your homework before you apply to see which companies are available at which locations. The more traditional tech companies (Google, Facebook, etc.) are mostly only available in Silicon Valley, with more finance/TV-advertising jobs available in NYC. Seattle/Toronto/Boston have their own flavours too.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Pros of Insight</h2>
                    <p>
                    There are a few big reasons why Insight was worthwhile. First and foremost, you highly increase the likelihood of ending up with a great job at a great company that pays 6-figures. Insight's connections are probably better than yours, and your application gets way more exposure/visibility for Data Science roles than you otherwise would get. As an example, one member of my cohort reported searching (unsuccessfully) for 6 months prior to attending Insight, while after the program they were among the first to get a job. In addition, before the demo phase each company comes to Insight to pitch to you, providing a rare opportunity to meet company members in person and ask whatever questions are on your mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Second, Insight felt like the real deal in terms of throwing you into the deep end and seeing how you swim. Although you will receive constant feedback from peers/program directors on the 'big picture' of your project, no one is going to do your project for you. It's up to you, and you alone, to get shit done, and there's no parent/supervisor/safety net to catch you if you fall. Although this can be a primary source of stress at Insight, and certainly has some downsides, I ultimately consider it a "feature not a bug". You learn a lot about yourself, grow faster than you otherwise would, and find the limits of what you're capable of. More than a few times I heard (and share) the sentiment, "if I had this kind of productivity while doing my PhD I would have completed it in half the time!". This being said, week 3 was really tough for me and I don't want to go through it again anytime soon (I break into a cold sweat just thinking about it).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Third, once accepted to Insight you really do become part of a family. Coming from academia, I didn't have a huge network of connections in Data Science to help with my transition. However, once accepted to Insight I instantly gained access to hundreds of alum who are now working in the field. I have leveraged this network for many purposes from project ideation to interview prep to work visa advice. Every single Insight alum I've interacted with has been incredibly kind and helpful, and has especially motivated me to "pay it forward" and be as kind and helpful to future Fellows (and non-Fellows!) as I can. Equally as important, you become close with your cohort, bonding over successes and stresses, inside and outside the office (or in our case, partying inside the office after hours (I know, we're lame)). Many members of my cohort I consider to be close friends, and will remain so into the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Fourth, it does really seem like the bond with Insight carries into the future. For example, waiting for my visa in Canada was stressful since there was some non-negligible chance that it wouldn't work out (long story, ask me over a beer). However, the Toronto location of Insight said they were absolutely willing to help me find another job in Canada should my visa not work out, a kind gesture that does not go unappreciated. In addition, while at Insight I saw a few examples of alum being helped by Insight to change jobs (from an existing job that they previously got through the program!). From a monetary perspective, there's no clear incentive for Insight to do this, as (to my understanding) Insight only gets commission from the initial placement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally, Insight does a great job of rounding out your skills and character in a short amount of time. Surrounded by a cohort of PhDs and program directors in a fast paced environment, you pick up data science skills a lot faster than you otherwise would. You also get a lot of feedback/advice on "soft skills" that are important to thrive - effective communication, elevator pitches on your background/project, resume tips, salary negotiation, etc. In addition, at Insight there is a "fail fast" mantra that makes you a better version of yourself. Throughout the program you constantly experience forms of rejection - your project idea still sucks, you realize after whiteboarding that you know wayyy less SQL than you thought, you didn't get a callback from Company X, etc. Similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vZXgApsPCQ">this guy</a> you become more comfortable with rejection, allowing you to grow more quickly.

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to Best Prepare for Insight</h2>
                    <p>
                    For those who have been accepted to the program (congrats!!) but haven't started yet, there's a few key things I'd recommend doing to maximize your chances of success. If you are thinking of applying to Insight but haven't been accepted yet, I'd still recommend doing all but the first:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    First, start thinking of project ideas now <i>and bounce them off people who have some combination of tech/business experience</i>. Before I came to Insight I had come up with 6 different project ideas, however I was still very much in an academic mentality. All of the ideas were quickly (and rightfully) rejected by the program directors in the first week, and I found myself having to start again from scratch. Being able to answer the questions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>How would my project generate business value for Company X today?</li>
                            <li>How could I generalize my project to generate business value for other companies/sectors?</li>
                        </ul>
                        are especially important to answer since you'll ultimately be demoing your project to mulitple companies and this question WILL come up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Second, learn. Python. now. I saw a lot of Fellows struggle with their projects because they were simultaneously trying to learn Python and complete their project, making everything take twice as long. Reading a book about Python doesn't count. Do a mini data science project in Python (and put it on GitHub!) before the program starts. Ask your friend whose an experienced Python programmer to give you advice on that triple-nested for loop. Do coding challenges on <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">leetcode</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Third, sharpen up on your machine learning. Broadly speaking, you should know about the popular supervised/unsupervised algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, recommender systems, LDA, K-means), as well as best practices/concepts (cross validation, train/test split, bias-variance tradeoff, unbalanced classes, regularization, loss functions). More than memorizing an algorithm, it's important to know the pros/cons (e.g. when would I use logistic regression over random forest?). After the project phase of Insight you basically get 2 weeks of interview prep before interviews start, and the more of these concepts you're unfamiliar with the more you'll end up just cramming/memorizing vs. genuinely understanding. Regardless of the specific role you want in Data Science, machine learning knowledge is a requirement (unlike e.g. SQL), and especially for the more tech-heavy roles the interviewers will know if you just memorized an algorithm yesterday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Fourth, work on your communication skills. Getting a job at Company X largely depends on your ability to explain your project and background to non-experts. If you're a really smart person but don't know how to communicate ideas in a simple manner you are unlikely to get the job. It's also important to get some kind of <i>outside confirmation</i> that you're a good communicator. Most people I've met think they're good communicators, but it's generally a rare skill. You're also going to have to do this in a public speaking kind of environment, i.e. at the front of the room to an audience of people. So, give a public lecture on your research AND get feedback on it. Sign up to lead the weekly arXiv paper discussion AND get feedback on it. Try explaining your PhD research to your grandmother and her friends AND get feedback on it.
