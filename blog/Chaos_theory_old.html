Introduction
</p>

<h5>Resonance</h5>
<p>
If you want, you can skip this section for now, and when it feels relevant to, come back to this section and read it. Example of precessing orbits, embed video.

<h5>Experiment</h5>
<p>
Here I'm going to demonstrate a simple example of chaos generated by a mock solar system. In this system we have two planets (both Neptune sized) orbiting around a central star at distances of 1AU and 1.08AU. In the figure below we see two particular realizations which I call "System A" and "System B". The <b>only</b> difference between System A and System B are the initial starting positions of the planets along their orbit. Everything else (masses, radii, semi-major axis, eccentricity, etc.) are the same. The plan is to evolve these systems into the future for a million years, and measure how different the evolutions are. If chaos is at play here, as mentioned above, tiny changes in the initial conditions should result in drastic observable differences in the evolution of these systems.

<p>
In order to measure chaos we need an observable, or measured quantity. For our system, the quantity of interest is a funny variable called \(z\), which is equal to \(z = e*exp(iw) \), \(e\) and \(w\) are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(mathematics)">eccentricity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_periapsis">argument of periapsis</a>, which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements">orbital elements</a>. \(i\) is indicating that this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex number</a>. Unforunately, \(z\) can't be visualized in a physical way, though eccentricity and argument of periapsis certainly can. It's not imperative that you have a good grasp on what \(z\), just understand that it's variable describing how orbits interact, and can be used to measure chaos in astrophysical systems.
</p>
<p>
The two outputs below show the results of System A and System B. In each figure, the top panel shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">fourier transform</a>, while the bottom panel shows the time series of \(z\). For a good explanation of fourier transforms, I'd recommend <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/">this link</a>, but in short a fourier transform breaks down any time series into a series of sines and cosines. The more relevant a particular frequency is to a given time series, the stronger the resulting power at that frequency will be. For example, Earth orbits the sun every 365 days like clockwork (these motions can be predicted millions of years into the future), and so if we took a fourier transform of this signal we would see a single spike at a frequency of 1/365. In the fourier transforms below, I've converted the axis to Period and not frequency (for convenience), and so in our Earth example a single spike would show up at 365 (units are years).

<p>
Looking at these plots, we see that System A and System B tell very different stories. The fourier transform of \(z\) for System A is very "well behaved", showing only a couple sharp and distinct frequencies (corresponding to various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance#Mean-motion_resonances_in_the_Solar_System">mean motion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_resonance">secular</a> resonances). In contrast, System B is clearly exhibiting chaotic behaviour, having many frequencies present in the fourier transform, and seemingly unpredictable behaviour in the time series. To clarify, there are two levels of chaos at play here. The first level of chaos is stemming from the fact that System A and System B yielded very different results, yet the initial conditions were only slightly different. The second level of chaos is that System B is itself exhibiting chaotic behaviour, jumping around in complex, non-linear ways.
