                    <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Lorenz</a> was an early pioneer of chaos theory, quantifying its behaviour and popularizing it as a concept. He is also responsible for coining the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">The Butterfly Effect</a>. As mentioned above, chaos describes how near-identical systems can evolve into substantially different states over time. Since humans cannot measure anything to infinite precision, this means that for any chaotic system humans have a limited range of predictability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This is precisely why the weatherman is often wrong. Weather predictions are generated by inputting the current state (teperature, pressure, elevation, etc.) of a region into a computer and simulating future possible outcomes. However, we cannot know these values to infinite precision. For example, maybe we know that the temperature at 12:01pm is 21.1&#x2103;, but we cannot know that the temperature at 12:01:05:32:36pm is 21.11238774&#x2103;. Hence there is <i>always</i> measurement error, and future weather predictions will be uncertain. It is worth mentioning that chaos is not binary (chaotic/not chaotic), and system A can be more chaotic than system B and in turn more chaotic than system C. One way of measuring the degree of chaos in a system with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">Lyapunov Exponent</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Although the weatherman often takes a lot of heat for being wrong (see what I did there), he is not alone. Any chaotic system will have a limited range of predictability. Think about how often economists make incorrect predictions, how often the American presidential election predictions are wrong, or how often your March Madness bracket crumbles despite all the research you poured into it. Chaos my friends.

                <p>
                I'm a visual learner, and so I thought it would be useful to show a visual example of chaos. I'm going to use an astrophysics example since it's the domain I'm most familiar with. Below shows two planetary systems consisting of a central star and two Neptune-sized planets (all shown as yellow dots). These two systems are <i>identical</i> except for the initial phase of the outer planet. By phase, I mean how many degrees of a full circle the planet has cycled through.

                OK, now let's simulate these systems using <a href="https://github.com/hannorein/rebound">REBOUND</a> for a couple thousand years (you can see the time in the bottom as "t=___", but it's small).

                Cool huh? The behaviour of system on the left is very irregular, suffering many close encounters. It's almost as if the planets are dancing with each other. As it turns out, these planets collide soon after the clip ends. For the video on the right however, the behaviour is very periodic, regular, and almost boring. As stated before, the <i>only</i> difference between these two systems was the initial phase of the outer planet. It's pretty amazing that such a small difference can have such a large effect on the system. In the left video the planetary system survives for roughly 10,000 years, while on the right the planetary system survives for millions. If these were real planetary systems and you had to pick which one to live on based only off the initial photos, it would be a pretty tough call.
                </p>
                <p>
                When scientists want to know whether a real planetary system is stable (be it the Solar System, an exoplanetary system discovered by Kepler, etc.), this is precisely how they do it. Thousands of near-identical systems are simulated and the results are aggregated to determine the typical lifetime of the system is. But as a result the answer is usually expressed as a probability vs. just a single number. For example, <a href="https://github.com/hannorein/rebound">studies</a> of the Solar System have shown that it is stable over billions of years, with Mercury having a 1% chance of colliding with Venus or the sun. Whew.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is the Source of Chaos?</h2>
                    <p>
                    Within planetary systems, chaos stems from overlapping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance">resonances</a>. Resonance occurs when the orbital period of one planet is an integer ratio of another. For example, Earth's orbital period is 365 days, and if (say) Mars had an orbital period of 365*(2/1) = 730 days, it would be in a 2:1 resonance with Earth. If Mars' orbital period was 365*(3/2) = 547.5 days it would be in a 3:2 resonance with Earth. Chaos occurs when planets are simultaneously in multiple resonances, which usually happens when there are multiple interacting planets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But more fundamentally, why does this lead to chaos? This is a very complicated answer but I'll try and answer it simply. Picture yourself as a child, getting pushed on a swing by your favourite parent. Since your parent is pushing the swing at its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance">resonant frequency</a>, your amplitude increases (i.e. you go higher and higher with every push). In contrast, if your parent was pushing the swing at random times (i.e. not at the resonant frequency) you would never get very high. This is an example of a single resonance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When two or more resonances are involved, things get interesting. To the right is a movie showing the double pendulum, which is another great example of chaos. In context of our running example the double pendulum is like two swings attached together, you on the top swing and (say) your younger sibling on the bottom one. At certain times, your siblings' resonant frequency will be activated, leading to a large amplitude swing, which will feed back onto your swing and affect your motion (e.g. maybe you don't get as high anymore cause your sibling 'stole' some of your energy). However, now that you are no longer swinging at exactly your resonant frequency, this will in turn will feed back and affect your siblings' motion, etc. The motion of each swing affects the total system in complicated, non-linear ways. Sometimes the swings may "catch a wave" together and excite one or both resonant frequencies leading to large amplitude swings, while other times the swings may exhibit seemingly predictable, boring behaviour.
