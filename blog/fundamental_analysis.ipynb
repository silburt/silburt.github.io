    "The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a financial theory stating that current asset prices reflect all available information. A direct consequence of this theory is that a trading strategy cannot be concocted to consistently beat the market, and future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing prices from the past. It is a hotly debated theory, being supported by many like Burton Malkiel (wrote <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>) and Eugene Fama (credited with founding the theory), while also being contested by many like Andrew Lo and Craig MacKinlay (co-authors of the paper <i>Stock Market Prices Do Not Follow Random Walks</i> with over 4000 citations).    \n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "If the EMH is false, money can be made by carefully selecting stocks. Surely you know of some person/entity who has boasted about analyzing market trends, carefully selecting a few stocks and earning huge profits. However, these cases by themselves don't falsify the EMH. For example, if I have 1,000 people each flip a coin 10 times, there will statistically be at least one person that flipped heads every single time. That person may think they are particularly amazing, when really it's just probability at play. Although random processes are used in many sectors of Finance today (e.g. Black-Scholes), it is still unclear whether stock prices really do evolve according to random walks.\n",

    "Regardless of theory, it is an interesting exercise to see whether Machine Learning + Fundamental Analysis can be used to empirically predict future stock prices. Specifically, can we take all the stocks from the Wilshire 5000 index, get their stock prices and fundamental qualities at years $t$ and $t-1$, and accurately predict the stock price at year $t+1$? For concreteness, I will choose $t=2015$, but my code is generalizable to any $t$. I will also cast this problem as a classification problem instead of a regression problem. This means that if a stock increased between years $t$ and $t+1$ the machine learning algorithm should predict $1$, and $0$ otherwise. In contrast, casting this as a regression problem would mean I want to predict <i>how much</i> a stock increased or decreased between $t$ and $t+1$. As you can imagine, this is a much more difficult problem."

In order to make a firm classification we have to set a threshold $T_w$, i.e. all stocks with a model-predicted probability greater than $T_w$ are classified by the model as winners, while all others are classified by the model as losers. A dotted line corresponding to $T_w = 0.9$ is shown in the plot above, and for this case many winning stocks are correctly classified as winners but some losing stocks are also incorrectly classified as winners in the process.

    "## Summary and Improvements\n",
    "In this post I walked through how to perform a fundamental analysis on a collection of stocks using machine learning in Python. In particular, I showed how to:\n",
    "- Get price data for stocks in Python.\n",
    "- Scrape financial data from Morningstar.com.\n",
    "- Clean stock data and generate usable features.\n",
    "- Train a machine learning algorithm to predict stock prices using financial data as input features.\n",
    "- Analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, one could start developing a trading strategy that would (hopefully) generate consistent positive returns over time. Looking at a few other years, sometimes the model doesn't do as well as hoped, while other times it does better. Further improvements could certainly be made to the above pipeline, like:\n",
    "- Breaking the Wilshire 5000 index into individual sectors. Different sectors have different baseline standards, and mixing them together can confuse the model. For example, according to the [Stern School of Business](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pbvdata.html) a Price/Book ratio of 1.5 is pretty good for a company in the banking sector but terrible for the broadcasting sector.\n",
    "- Filter by marketcap - like sectors, different market caps (small, medium, large) will also have different baseline standards. \n",
    "- Use a longer lookback time - Above we trained a model using only $t$ and $t-1$ to predict $t+1$, but one could easily extend the model to include $t-3$, $t-4$, ..., $t-X$ financial data.\n",
    "- Cast the problem as a regression problem instead of classification. This is a more difficult but fruitful problem, since now you are trying to predict a value. \n",
