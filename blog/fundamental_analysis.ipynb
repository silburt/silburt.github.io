    "The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a financial theory stating that current asset prices reflect all the available information. A direct extension of this theory is that a trading strategy cannot be concocted to consistently beat the market, and future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing prices from the past. It is a hotly debated theory, being supported by many like Burton Malkiel (wrote _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_) and Eugene Fama (credited with founding the theory), while also being contested by many like Andrew Lo and Craig MacKinlay (co-authored the paper _Stock Market Prices Do Not Follow Random Walks_ with >4000 citations).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Many believe that EMH is false, because then money can be made by carefully selecting stocks. Surely you know of someone/some entity that has boasted about analyzing market trends, selecting a few stocks, and earning huge profits. However, this by itself doesn't falsify the EMH. For example, if I have 1,000 people each flip a coin 10 times, there will statistically be at least one person that flipped 10 heads in a row. That person may think they are particularly amazing, when really it's just random processes + statistics at play. In addition, a kind of weird contradiction is that many believe the EMH is false and yet Markov processes are an industry standard in Finance these days (e.g. Black-Scholes).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of theory, it is an interesting exercise to see whether Machine Learning + Fundamental Analysis can be used to empirically predict future stock prices. Specifically, I will take all the stocks from the Wilshire 5000 index, get their stock prices and fundamental qualities at years $t$ and $t-1$, and see if the stock price at year $t+1$ can be accurately predicted. For concreteness, I will choose $t=2015$, but the code is generalizable to any $t$. I will also cast this problem as a classification problem instead of a regression problem. This means that if a stock increased between years $t$ and $t+1$ the machine learning algorithm should predict $1$, and $0$ otherwise. In contrast, casting this as a regression problem would mean I want to predict _how much_ a stock increased or decreased between $t$ and $t+1$. As you can imagine, this is much more difficult."
